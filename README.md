FLAPPY BIRD CLONE

This project is a step-by-step remake of the class taught by Rob Percival via Udemy with Android Native and the GDX library. All factors of mobile video game development are shown in this project including algorithm analysis and collision detection. To navigate to the source code, simple go into the "core" directory, then the "src/com/alexzanderavila/flappybird" directory, and select the "FlappyBird.java" file. 


PREREQUISITES

I use Android Studio for placing my project directly onto a device. However, I suppose any Android IDE may be used.


INSTALLING

To install, clone the project onto your desktop, or wherever you wish to have it stored. 
Open your Android IDE and select the Flappy Bird Clone directory as the project to open.
Run the project and select your device as the device to emulate on.


RUNTIME

This project runs just as the popular mobile game has. The only feature I did not implement is a type of leaderboard system. The game can still be played by simply tapping the screen to propel 'Flappy' upwards and through the pipes as they come.


TOOLS

Android Studio - the Android IDE used to develop this software

GDX - the Android Framework used for the development and methods commonly found in game development (create, render, etc.)
